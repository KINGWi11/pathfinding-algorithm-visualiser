# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualiser
## Windows desktop app that visualises pathfinding algorithms. Built with Visual Studio .Net WinForms in C#.

This program allows you to design a 2D grid of various node types using toolbar functions and generations, and then see how a selection of pathfinding algorithms behave when trying to find the shortest path within the grid, with functions that allow you to alter the simulation parameters.

This project was built and submitted for my A Level Computer Science coursework. The coursework was assessed based on the quality of the written report, which describes the development cycle of this project. The report mainly consists of documenting the implementation and testing of prototypes, but also includes sections involving prior analysis and research, designs and pseudocode, and post-development evaluation and tests. I achieved a mark of 68/70.
